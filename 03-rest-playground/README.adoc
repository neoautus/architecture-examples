== Dynamic Services and Interfaces

The goal of this example is to demonstrate the effective use of services, with a real-world use case based on JAX-RS & Jersey. The example is composed by a JAX-RS server (using Jersey) and a sample JAX-RS resource (called HelloService). The two components can be built and deployed independently, making possible to explore the development cycle with a live OSGi container and the services.

== Example Description

Having RESTful services is a frequent requirement for many systems. They are covered by the JAX-RS standard (JSR 311 & JSR 339), meaning that we have a set of standard classes and interfaces, and many frameworks.

Here we use *Jersey Framework*, which is _the JAX-RS Reference Implementation_. It offers a number of utilities, extensions and have it's own API with additional features. The component _JerseyService_ exposes Jersey & JAX-RS using servlet `/services`, and offers a simple status check on `/services/status`.

This example also includes the component _HelloService_, which shows how to create a dynamic, pluggable JAX-RS Application (or `ResourceConfig`, using Jersey terminology).

== Building

If you want to use the integrated Karaf, you can follow https://github.com/neoautus/architecture-examples/tree/master/stage-templates/apache-karaf-4.1[these instructions to build the Karaf stage].

* Run `ant build-rest-playground` from the example root;
+
or

* Run `ant build-all` from the subproject directory.

Afterwards, you can use just `ant` to rebuild changed modules. That will avoid the need to redeploy all Jersey bundles, which are already deployed after the initial `ant build-all`.

== Testing

* After building, if you are using the provided Karaf stage, the bundles are already copied into `deploy` directory and are ready to be deployed. If Karaf is running, they are *already deployed*;
* If you wish to test on another systems, the Jars you need are available in `03-rest-playground/dist` directory;

The bundle *JerseyService* will register a servlet using the alias `/services` and also a dummy resource `/status`. You will be able to open the URL `http://localhost:6502/services/status` on any navigator, or use a command line util like `curl` to run a test:

....
$ curl http://localhost:6502/services/status
Running
....

We have also the test bundle *HelloService*. It will be tracked by *JerseyService*, which will publish the resources on two different URLs, giving results like these:

....
$ curl http://localhost:6502/services/hello/helloWorld
Hello world!
$ curl http://localhost:6502/services/hello/helloMars/Shakespeare
Hello from Mars, Shakespeare
....

== Explanation

We have a lot going on here. First let's analyze the test bundle *HelloService*. It might seem that we're starting backwards (and we are), but it's useful to know what's inside a JAX-RS resource bundle _before_ seeing what the *JerseyService* is doing with it.

=== The Bundle HelloService

The bundle *HelloService* illustrates a JAX-RS component. The main configuration is defined inside the class `HelloConfig` which sets both JAX-RS and OSGi features.

==== Class HelloConfig

Starting with OSGi features, the annotations `@Component`, `@Instantiate` and `@Provides` are used to 1) declare a *_component_* class; 2) Use that class to *_instantiate_* and register an object; and finally 3) publish the object as a _service_ which *_provides_* the interface `ResourceConfig`. This makes the `HelloConfig` object instance _"magically"_ visible to `JerseyService`.

IMPORTANT: It's usual (and good practice) to limit the propagation of OSGi-related stuff inside your code. Once we declared the OSGi component, we are done. We will not use any OSGi trickery outside `HelloConfig`.

[source,Java]
----
@ApplicationPath ("/hello")
@Component (immediate = true, publicFactory = false)
@Instantiate
@Provides
public class HelloConfig extends ResourceConfig
{
    public HelloConfig ()
    {
        // Register resources and providers using package-scanning
        packages (getClass ().getPackage ().getName ());
    }
}
----

For JAX-RS features, the class defines `@ApplicationPath` as `/hello`. This instructs Jersey to deploy a new JAX-RS servlet on `/services/hello`, directing RESTful requests to this bundle. The method `packages()` also tells Jersey to look for resources on classes belonging to package `org.lucidj.helloservice`. Let's take a look at the classes it will discover, `HelloWorldResource` and `HelloMarsResource`.

==== Class HelloWorldResource

The class `HelloWorldResource` is defined as follows:

[source,Java]
----
@Path ("helloWorld")
public class HelloWorldResource
{
    @GET
    @Produces ("text/plain")
    public String sayHello ()
    {
        return ("Hello World!\n");
    }
}
----

It sets the `@Path` as `helloWorld`, so you can test it using:

....
$ curl http://localhost:6502/services/hello/helloWorld
Hello world!
....

==== Class HelloMarsResource

The class `HelloMarsResource` shows a little more JAX-RS features, like a variable `name` inside a URI path template:

[source,Java]
----
@Path ("helloMars")
public class HelloMarsResource
{
    @GET
    @Produces ("text/plain")
    @Path ("{name}")
    public String sayHello (@PathParam ("name") String name)
    {
        return ("Hello from Mars, " + name + "\n");
    }
}
----

The class `HelloMarsResource` is defining `@Path` as `helloMars` and also a method-level `@Path` variable called `{name}`, which is replaced by Jersey with the help of `@PathParam`. You can test it like this:

....
$ curl http://localhost:6502/services/hello/helloMars/Shakespeare
Hello from Mars, Shakespeare
....

Notice that we are on plain, familiar JAX-RS territory. You can do whatever you want, use any Jersey or JAX-RS features you wish.

=== The Bundle JerseyService

This bundle tracks and instantiates JAX-RS resources and uses a lot more OSGi features, because here we actually do some component gluing. We will focus on OSGi, since here Jersey works as usual.

Please refer to `JerseyService.java` full source code to have a broader view. We will analyze parts of the code, always focusing on specific features.

==== JerseyService as OSGi Component

[source,Java]
----
@Component (immediate = true, publicFactory = false)
@Instantiate
public class JerseyService
----

The class `JerseyService` is declared here as an OSGi component. Notice however that, even tough the class is instantiated, the object is _never_ published as service. In fact, this component doesn't have to publish services, since it's already "publishing" the Jersey servlets, so to speak.

==== Importing a Service with `@Requires`

[source,Java]
----
@Requires
private HttpService httpService;
----

The annotation `@Requires` marks a variable which will be injected with a service instance _with the same type_ as the variable (in this case `HttpService`). This only happens _after_ the constructor call, when the framework calls the method marked with `@Validate` (see <<Service Life-cycle with `@Validate` and `@Invalidate`>> below).

Notice that `@Requires` also creates an explicit _dependency_ of the required service. The service is needed for this component to start, and if the service goes away or changes, this component is updated.

==== Tracking Services using `@Bind` and `@Unbind`

[source,Java]
----
@Bind (aggregate=true, optional=true, specification = Configurable.class)
private void bindConfigurable (Configurable config)
{
    if (config instanceof ResourceConfig)
    {
        publish_jersey_resource ((ResourceConfig)config);
    }
}

@Unbind
private void unbindConfigurable (Configurable config)
{
    if (config instanceof ResourceConfig)
    {
        remove_jersey_resource ((ResourceConfig)config);
    }
}
----

The JAX-RS resources are tracked using their interface `javax.ws.rs.core.Configurable`. *Any component* implementing (or extending) this interface, will be notified on the method `bindConfigurable` as soon as it becomes active.

Since one of the classes that implement `Configurable` is `ResourceConfig`, we keep track of these specific Jersey resources, publishing or removing the Jersey servlets as needed.

==== Service Life-cycle with `@Validate` and `@Invalidate`

[source,Java]
----
@Validate
private void validate ()
{
    // The component is ready, all @Requires services are available
}

@Invalidate
private void invalidate ()
{
    // The component is being shutdown, probably the bundle is going away
}
----

These annotations mark the service life-cycle. When a Java object is published as a OSGi service, it's life-cycle can be tracked for us.

The `@Validate` and `@Invalidate` annotations designate which methods will be called once the object is ready (for instance, when all it's service `@Requires` are satisfied) and when the object should do it's cleanup, like when the bundle is being deactivated.

== Notes

This subproject illustrates a simple yet functional JAX-RS component. It's important to explore and understand it, because we have here all the foundations of much more complex components.
